## Algorithms & Data Structures

### 1. Huffman Tree
To construct the Huffman Tree, the following steps are performed:
- **Initialize the Priority Queue**:  
  Each character with a non-zero frequency becomes a leaf. The priority queue sorts nodes by frequency, with the lowest at the top using a custom comparator.
- **Merge Nodes**:  
  Two nodes with the lowest frequency are removed, merged into a new inner node with a frequency equal to their sum, and reinserted into the queue.  
  This process continues until one node remains, becoming the tree's root.
- **Generate Codes**:  
  A recursive function generates binary codes for each character, appending '0' for left traversal and '1' for right traversal.

### 2. Encoding Algorithm
- **Create Temporary Storage**:  
  Iterate over each character in the input text, retrieve its ASCII value, and replace it with its corresponding Huffman code.
- **Convert Binary Data to 8-Bit Chunks**:  
  Slice the binary string into 8-bit chunks, convert each to a character, and handle any remaining bits by padding with zeros.
- **Store Padding Information**:  
  The number of padding bits is saved to ensure accurate data reconstruction during decompression.

### 3. Decoding Algorithm
- **Initialize Variables**:  
  An empty string stores the decoded text, and a pointer tracks the current position in the encoded text.
- **Iterative Decoding**:  
  Accumulate bits into a temporary string and check for matches in the Huffman Map. Once a match is found, append the corresponding character to the decoded text.
- **Update Position**:  
  Adjust the pointer to continue decoding the next segment of the encoded text.

### 4. Compression
- Verify the input file is a `.txt` file. If not, output an error and stop execution.
- Generate a frequency array and build the Huffman Tree and Map.
- Create a header structure for decompression, including:
  1. Character Byte (the letter)
  2. Huffman Code Size Byte
  3. Huffman Code encoded into bytes.
- Convert the file content to a binary string using the Huffman Map, encode it, and write the compressed content to a new file.

### 5. Decompression
- Verify the input file is a `.hassan` file. If not, output an error and stop execution.
- Reconstruct the Huffman Map from the header structure.
- Convert the binary string back to the original text by mapping binary sequences to their corresponding characters.
- Write the decompressed content into a new `.txt` file.
